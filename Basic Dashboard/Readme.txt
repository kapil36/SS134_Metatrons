RFID readers are placed in each room of prison. In our project the prisoners will have a tag id( wrist band tag or micro rfid tag in uniform)
As the prisoners freely move in premise the RFID tag will come in contact of different RFID readers placed in each room.
The data will be collected and stored in excel sheet with date time and tag id of prisoner.
The excel sheet can be send to web dashboard or operations of machine learning and R programming can be performed on data to display frequent visists,no visits and frequency of moving.
